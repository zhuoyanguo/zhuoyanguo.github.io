# Data Analyst

## About Me
Iâ€™m a data analyst with two years of experience working in the education sector, currently supporting data-driven decision-making at The SEED Foundation. My work focuses on designing performance dashboards, automating data workflows, and transforming student and survey data into actionable insights for school leadership teams.

I graduated from Georgetown University in 2025 with a masterâ€™s degree in Data Science and Analytics, and I previously worked as a data analyst with Georgetownâ€™s Office of Biomedical Graduate Education (BGE). While much of my experience is in education, Iâ€™m excited to explore how data analysis can drive impact across other industries as well.

ðŸ“Œ See SEED Foundation Project and BGE Project for examples of my work.

Currently based in Arlington, VA â€” open to hybrid/remote data roles.
