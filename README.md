Currently based in Arlington, VA — open to hybrid/remote data roles.


# Work Experience
## The SEED Foundation
*Data Analyst | Washington D.C. | Jan 2024-Present*

**1. Processing school assessment data in Python:**
   To clean and analyze raw assessment data, I built an automated data pipeline using pandas.

   After processing, I designed interactive dashboards in Google Looker Studio to visualize SEL trends, enabling leadership to interpret and act on the results easily.

**1.Scraping Alumni Career Outcomes from LinkedIn:**
   Wrote a Python script to automate the extraction of LinkedIn profiles using available alumni information. 
   This replaced a manual lookup process, significantly reducing the time spent on workforce data collection.

   I also trained a text classification model to automatically categorize alumni by industry and sector based on their LinkedIn job titles and company information.

    A big data project using Spark NLP on AWS to analyze which types of sentiment are most associated with popular posts in emotional subreddits like r/TIFU.
    The project involved large-scale text preprocessing, sentiment classification, and popularity modeling using upvotes and engagement as key metrics.
