# Data Analyst

## About Me
I’m a data analyst with two years of experience in the education sector, currently leading data processing and analysis efforts at The SEED Foundation. 
I design and maintain end-to-end data workflows — from cleaning and structuring raw data to conducting in-depth analysis and delivering executive-facing visualizations that guide school- and network-level decision-making.

While much of my experience is in education, I’m excited to explore how data analysis can drive impact across other industries as well.

Currently based in Arlington, VA — open to hybrid/remote data roles.
