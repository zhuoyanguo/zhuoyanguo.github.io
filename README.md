# Data Analyst

## About Me
I’m a data analyst with two years of experience in the education sector, currently leading data processing and analysis at The SEED Foundation. 

I hold a master’s degree in Data Science and Analytics from Georgetown University and have also supported alumni career outcome analysis at Georgetown’s BGE office.

Currently based in Arlington, VA — open to hybrid/remote data roles.


## Work Experience
## The SEED Foundation
*Data Analyst | Washington D.C. | Jan 2024-Present*

**1. Processing school assessment data in Python:**
   To clean and analyze raw assessment data, I built an automated data pipeline using pandas.

   After processing, I designed interactive dashboards in Google Looker Studio to visualize SEL trends, enabling leadership to easily interpret and act on the results.

**1.Scraping Alumni Career Outcomes from LinkedIn**
   
   I wrote a Python script to automate the extraction of LinkedIn profiles using available alumni information. 
   This replaced a manual lookup process, significantly reducing the time spent on workforce data collection.

   I also trained a text classification model to automatically categorize alumni into industries and sectors based on their LinkedIn job titles and company information.
